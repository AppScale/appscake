#Appscake - Web Frontend for AppScale Tools #

## About ##

"AppsCake makes deploying AppScale a piece of cake"

AppsCake is a simple and lightweight web application that allows users to
interact with AppScale tools over the web. This way even those users who
are not familiar with general cloud principles or those who are not
comfortable working with a traditional command line interface can get
started with deploying AppScale clouds and AppScale cloud applications.

AppsCake has been developed using the python programming language and is
based on Django.
